       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       "xxbos \" xxmaj my xxmaj favorite xxmaj year \" is a very funny and charming piece of nostalgia that wears just a little bit too much of its sincerity on its sleeve . xxmaj the opening shots of the classic xxmaj new xxmaj york skyline bring back fond memories of films set in xxmaj new xxmaj york like \" xxmaj on the xxmaj town \" and \" xxmaj bells xxmaj are xxmaj ringing \" , both of which opened with very similar views ( and both of which had lyrics by xxmaj adolph xxmaj green , who appears in the film as xxmaj leo ) . xxmaj there are many parallels to classic comedy in a broader sense as well , like the relationship between has - been swashbuckling icon xxmaj alan xxmaj swann ( xxmaj peter o'toole ) and his chauffeur / manservant which mirrors the classic xxmaj jeeves and xxmaj wooster dichotomy loosely . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the story is very straightforward  xxmaj swann must make an appearance on a xxup tv variety show hosted by xxmaj king xxmaj kaiser ( xxmaj joe xxmaj bologna ) to appease the xxup irs . xxmaj when he shows up \" plastered \" ( \" so are some of the best erections in xxmaj europe \" ! he exclaims ) for the first rehearsal he risks losing the job but is saved by nerdy writer xxmaj benjy xxmaj stone ( xxmaj mark xxmaj linn - xxmaj baker ) , who must act as his chaperone for the rest of the week in xxup nyc . xxmaj in the course of that week xxmaj stone somewhat accidentally teaches xxmaj swann that what he 's missing the most is a solid family relationship , and xxmaj swann teaches xxmaj stone how to be more confident and go after the things that he wants at all costs . xxmaj there 's also an interesting theme here concerning what we choose to show to other people . xxmaj stone confesses that his name is \" xxmaj xxunk \" or something like that , a very xxmaj jewish name , and xxmaj swann confesses about his child whom he has not seen in years . xxmaj the idea i think is that no one would guess that these two very hyper - kinetic and funny individuals were harboring such pain and guilt , but they are able to tell each other because of the mutual respect that exists between friends . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i thought the movie was very funny although in the end the plot about xxmaj swann 's family becomes a bit too obvious and sentimental . xxmaj but there are just too many hilarious moments to complain too much . xxmaj the only other comedy i 've seen with o'toole was \" xxmaj what 's xxmaj new xxmaj pussycat ? \" , which i thought was kind of lame . xxmaj he was very , very funny in this one . xxmaj an even bigger surprise is xxmaj joe xxmaj bologna in the role of a xxmaj sid xxmaj caesar - esquire comedian full of swagger and arrogance , a man who would probably blame the pope if he slipped on a banana peal in the xxmaj vatican . xxmaj the scene where he squares up with a tough gangster ( played by the appropriately surly xxmaj cameron xxmaj mitchell , taking quite a big step up from his recent films like \" xxmaj tool xxmaj box xxmaj murders \" ) is one for the ages . xxmaj and unlike a lot of show- business comedies that end in \" the big show \" ( even \" xxmaj the xxmaj producers ) the conclusion of this film was far from a let - down . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i really felt like i was watching a film from the classic era  not just because of the high quality of the script and the actors , but because this film knows how to present an innocent kind of charm in a sophisticated way ; it 's a far cry from the juvenile ( though occasionally hilarious ) films being pumped out of the teenage movie factory that xxmaj hollywood became in the 1980s . xxmaj in other words , it 's a film with class and integrity . xxmaj and speaking of \" xxmaj the xxmaj producers \" , i think a musical version of this film might be a very good idea .,xxbos xxmaj in xxup wwii xxmaj england a troop of xxunk are dispatched into a characteristically happy - go - lucky and scenic village , though really they are a select assemblage of xxmaj german officers with orders to seize control of the township on the horizon of a covert xxmaj german attack in a few days . xxmaj director xxmaj alberto xxmaj xxunk is smart . xxmaj rather than this information creeping up on us like a twist , we grasp this from the start . xxmaj when one of the villagers grows suspicious , we are in an enhanced state of tension . xxmaj the xxmaj germans hijack the parish , a handful among which refuse to lose hope of alerting the unsuspecting free world around them . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj do not make the mistake of presuming that it is an insincere propaganda yarn , considering its era . xxmaj this is in fact quite an electrifying tale of survival . xxmaj if so many can overlook the propaganda of obsolete films like xxmaj battleship xxmaj potemkin , there is certainly room for this picture . xxmaj it stands out , owing much to its unexpected flashes of violence that are sincerely exhilarating and often frank and uncompromising in terms of the drama . xxmaj it is not gritty like most modern war films . xxmaj the xxunk timeless xxmaj english ambiance , and the consistent theme of it maintaining its spry morale , is a clever and natural juxtaposition to the taut aggression of the conflict , which is thus more well - defined . xxmaj the relatively unfamiliar cast is plainly high- quality . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj at its hub , yes , it 's a work of propaganda exploiting a thriller story to enrapture its xxup wwii - era xxmaj british spectators . xxmaj but mind you , it is based on a story by xxmaj english writer and xxup wwii xxup mi6 spy xxmaj graham xxmaj greene . xxmaj nevertheless , the xxmaj english were righteous in that war , remaining the only xxmaj european country the xxmaj germans intended to occupy but never could . xxmaj this piece grows to be as riveting as any other good movie , and what 's more , its unexpected violence causes it to project with particular prominence .,xxbos i heard so many good things about this movie that i thought \" xxmaj oh , i 've got to see that \" . xxmaj then i realised i 'd rented it a couple of weeks before and rather enjoyed it . i can usually remember films very clearly but this one is so predictable that it had just evaporated from my memory . xxmaj still , it 's certainly a well - acted story of social change in a small town ( despite the loathsome , stodgy music - i hate brass bands ) and worth a look . xxmaj incidentally , it 's interesting that most of the pro - xxmaj thatcher comments have been written by xxmaj americans who would be unlikely to tolerate her born - to - rule attitude . xxmaj an institution like the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords would n't last a nanosecond in the liberty - loving xxup usa , thank xxmaj god !,xxbos i 'm at a total loss when i read the other reviews about this movie . i 'm seriously wondering if we all watched the same movie . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj now , what in particular was the points which dragged the movie down ? \n",
       " \n",
       "  1 ) xxmaj the tempo was god - awful slow . \n",
       " \n",
       "  2 ) xxmaj the plot was as original as the xxunk western flick in late 1979 . \n",
       " \n",
       "  3 ) xxmaj the acting was horrible with the exception of xxmaj ben xxmaj cross which was the only real actor in this debacle . \n",
       " \n",
       "  4 ) xxmaj dolph had as many ( and well thought out ) lines in this flick as he did as xxmaj drago in xxmaj rocky xxup iv . \n",
       " \n",

       "xxbos \" xxmaj my xxmaj favorite xxmaj year \" is a very funny and charming piece of nostalgia that wears just a little bit too much of its sincerity on its sleeve . xxmaj the opening shots of the classic xxmaj new xxmaj york skyline bring back fond memories of films set in xxmaj new xxmaj york like \" xxmaj on the xxmaj town \" and \" xxmaj bells xxmaj are xxmaj ringing \" , both of which opened with very similar views ( and both of which had lyrics by xxmaj adolph xxmaj green , who appears in the film as xxmaj leo ) . xxmaj there are many parallels to classic comedy in a broader sense as well , like the relationship between has - been swashbuckling icon xxmaj alan xxmaj swann ( xxmaj peter o'toole ) and his chauffeur / manservant which mirrors the classic xxmaj jeeves and xxmaj wooster dichotomy loosely . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the story is very straightforward  xxmaj swann must make an appearance on a xxup tv variety show hosted by xxmaj king xxmaj kaiser ( xxmaj joe xxmaj bologna ) to appease the xxup irs . xxmaj when he shows up \" plastered \" ( \" so are some of the best erections in xxmaj europe \" ! he exclaims ) for the first rehearsal he risks losing the job but is saved by nerdy writer xxmaj benjy xxmaj stone ( xxmaj mark xxmaj linn - xxmaj baker ) , who must act as his chaperone for the rest of the week in xxup nyc . xxmaj in the course of that week xxmaj stone somewhat accidentally teaches xxmaj swann that what he 's missing the most is a solid family relationship , and xxmaj swann teaches xxmaj stone how to be more confident and go after the things that he wants at all costs . xxmaj there 's also an interesting theme here concerning what we choose to show to other people . xxmaj stone confesses that his name is \" xxmaj xxunk \" or something like that , a very xxmaj jewish name , and xxmaj swann confesses about his child whom he has not seen in years . xxmaj the idea i think is that no one would guess that these two very hyper - kinetic and funny individuals were harboring such pain and guilt , but they are able to tell each other because of the mutual respect that exists between friends . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i thought the movie was very funny although in the end the plot about xxmaj swann 's family becomes a bit too obvious and sentimental . xxmaj but there are just too many hilarious moments to complain too much . xxmaj the only other comedy i 've seen with o'toole was \" xxmaj what 's xxmaj new xxmaj pussycat ? \" , which i thought was kind of lame . xxmaj he was very , very funny in this one . xxmaj an even bigger surprise is xxmaj joe xxmaj bologna in the role of a xxmaj sid xxmaj caesar - esquire comedian full of swagger and arrogance , a man who would probably blame the pope if he slipped on a banana peal in the xxmaj vatican . xxmaj the scene where he squares up with a tough gangster ( played by the appropriately surly xxmaj cameron xxmaj mitchell , taking quite a big step up from his recent films like \" xxmaj tool xxmaj box xxmaj murders \" ) is one for the ages . xxmaj and unlike a lot of show- business comedies that end in \" the big show \" ( even \" xxmaj the xxmaj producers ) the conclusion of this film was far from a let - down . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i really felt like i was watching a film from the classic era  not just because of the high quality of the script and the actors , but because this film knows how to present an innocent kind of charm in a sophisticated way ; it 's a far cry from the juvenile ( though occasionally hilarious ) films being pumped out of the teenage movie factory that xxmaj hollywood became in the 1980s . xxmaj in other words , it 's a film with class and integrity . xxmaj and speaking of \" xxmaj the xxmaj producers \" , i think a musical version of this film might be a very good idea .,xxbos xxmaj in xxup wwii xxmaj england a troop of xxunk are dispatched into a characteristically happy - go - lucky and scenic village , though really they are a select assemblage of xxmaj german officers with orders to seize control of the township on the horizon of a covert xxmaj german attack in a few days . xxmaj director xxmaj alberto xxmaj xxunk is smart . xxmaj rather than this information creeping up on us like a twist , we grasp this from the start . xxmaj when one of the villagers grows suspicious , we are in an enhanced state of tension . xxmaj the xxmaj germans hijack the parish , a handful among which refuse to lose hope of alerting the unsuspecting free world around them . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj do not make the mistake of presuming that it is an insincere propaganda yarn , considering its era . xxmaj this is in fact quite an electrifying tale of survival . xxmaj if so many can overlook the propaganda of obsolete films like xxmaj battleship xxmaj potemkin , there is certainly room for this picture . xxmaj it stands out , owing much to its unexpected flashes of violence that are sincerely exhilarating and often frank and uncompromising in terms of the drama . xxmaj it is not gritty like most modern war films . xxmaj the xxunk timeless xxmaj english ambiance , and the consistent theme of it maintaining its spry morale , is a clever and natural juxtaposition to the taut aggression of the conflict , which is thus more well - defined . xxmaj the relatively unfamiliar cast is plainly high- quality . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj at its hub , yes , it 's a work of propaganda exploiting a thriller story to enrapture its xxup wwii - era xxmaj british spectators . xxmaj but mind you , it is based on a story by xxmaj english writer and xxup wwii xxup mi6 spy xxmaj graham xxmaj greene . xxmaj nevertheless , the xxmaj english were righteous in that war , remaining the only xxmaj european country the xxmaj germans intended to occupy but never could . xxmaj this piece grows to be as riveting as any other good movie , and what 's more , its unexpected violence causes it to project with particular prominence .,xxbos i heard so many good things about this movie that i thought \" xxmaj oh , i 've got to see that \" . xxmaj then i realised i 'd rented it a couple of weeks before and rather enjoyed it . i can usually remember films very clearly but this one is so predictable that it had just evaporated from my memory . xxmaj still , it 's certainly a well - acted story of social change in a small town ( despite the loathsome , stodgy music - i hate brass bands ) and worth a look . xxmaj incidentally , it 's interesting that most of the pro - xxmaj thatcher comments have been written by xxmaj americans who would be unlikely to tolerate her born - to - rule attitude . xxmaj an institution like the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords would n't last a nanosecond in the liberty - loving xxup usa , thank xxmaj god !,xxbos i 'm at a total loss when i read the other reviews about this movie . i 'm seriously wondering if we all watched the same movie . \n",

       "xxbos \" xxmaj my xxmaj favorite xxmaj year \" is a very funny and charming piece of nostalgia that wears just a little bit too much of its sincerity on its sleeve . xxmaj the opening shots of the classic xxmaj new xxmaj york skyline bring back fond memories of films set in xxmaj new xxmaj york like \" xxmaj on the xxmaj town \" and \" xxmaj bells xxmaj are xxmaj ringing \" , both of which opened with very similar views ( and both of which had lyrics by xxmaj adolph xxmaj green , who appears in the film as xxmaj leo ) . xxmaj there are many parallels to classic comedy in a broader sense as well , like the relationship between has - been swashbuckling icon xxmaj alan xxmaj swann ( xxmaj peter o'toole ) and his chauffeur / manservant which mirrors the classic xxmaj jeeves and xxmaj wooster dichotomy loosely . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the story is very straightforward  xxmaj swann must make an appearance on a xxup tv variety show hosted by xxmaj king xxmaj kaiser ( xxmaj joe xxmaj bologna ) to appease the xxup irs . xxmaj when he shows up \" plastered \" ( \" so are some of the best erections in xxmaj europe \" ! he exclaims ) for the first rehearsal he risks losing the job but is saved by nerdy writer xxmaj benjy xxmaj stone ( xxmaj mark xxmaj linn - xxmaj baker ) , who must act as his chaperone for the rest of the week in xxup nyc . xxmaj in the course of that week xxmaj stone somewhat accidentally teaches xxmaj swann that what he 's missing the most is a solid family relationship , and xxmaj swann teaches xxmaj stone how to be more confident and go after the things that he wants at all costs . xxmaj there 's also an interesting theme here concerning what we choose to show to other people . xxmaj stone confesses that his name is \" xxmaj xxunk \" or something like that , a very xxmaj jewish name , and xxmaj swann confesses about his child whom he has not seen in years . xxmaj the idea i think is that no one would guess that these two very hyper - kinetic and funny individuals were harboring such pain and guilt , but they are able to tell each other because of the mutual respect that exists between friends . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i thought the movie was very funny although in the end the plot about xxmaj swann 's family becomes a bit too obvious and sentimental . xxmaj but there are just too many hilarious moments to complain too much . xxmaj the only other comedy i 've seen with o'toole was \" xxmaj what 's xxmaj new xxmaj pussycat ? \" , which i thought was kind of lame . xxmaj he was very , very funny in this one . xxmaj an even bigger surprise is xxmaj joe xxmaj bologna in the role of a xxmaj sid xxmaj caesar - esquire comedian full of swagger and arrogance , a man who would probably blame the pope if he slipped on a banana peal in the xxmaj vatican . xxmaj the scene where he squares up with a tough gangster ( played by the appropriately surly xxmaj cameron xxmaj mitchell , taking quite a big step up from his recent films like \" xxmaj tool xxmaj box xxmaj murders \" ) is one for the ages . xxmaj and unlike a lot of show- business comedies that end in \" the big show \" ( even \" xxmaj the xxmaj producers ) the conclusion of this film was far from a let - down . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i really felt like i was watching a film from the classic era  not just because of the high quality of the script and the actors , but because this film knows how to present an innocent kind of charm in a sophisticated way ; it 's a far cry from the juvenile ( though occasionally hilarious ) films being pumped out of the teenage movie factory that xxmaj hollywood became in the 1980s . xxmaj in other words , it 's a film with class and integrity . xxmaj and speaking of \" xxmaj the xxmaj producers \" , i think a musical version of this film might be a very good idea .,xxbos xxmaj in xxup wwii xxmaj england a troop of xxunk are dispatched into a characteristically happy - go - lucky and scenic village , though really they are a select assemblage of xxmaj german officers with orders to seize control of the township on the horizon of a covert xxmaj german attack in a few days . xxmaj director xxmaj alberto xxmaj xxunk is smart . xxmaj rather than this information creeping up on us like a twist , we grasp this from the start . xxmaj when one of the villagers grows suspicious , we are in an enhanced state of tension . xxmaj the xxmaj germans hijack the parish , a handful among which refuse to lose hope of alerting the unsuspecting free world around them . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj do not make the mistake of presuming that it is an insincere propaganda yarn , considering its era . xxmaj this is in fact quite an electrifying tale of survival . xxmaj if so many can overlook the propaganda of obsolete films like xxmaj battleship xxmaj potemkin , there is certainly room for this picture . xxmaj it stands out , owing much to its unexpected flashes of violence that are sincerely exhilarating and often frank and uncompromising in terms of the drama . xxmaj it is not gritty like most modern war films . xxmaj the xxunk timeless xxmaj english ambiance , and the consistent theme of it maintaining its spry morale , is a clever and natural juxtaposition to the taut aggression of the conflict , which is thus more well - defined . xxmaj the relatively unfamiliar cast is plainly high- quality . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj at its hub , yes , it 's a work of propaganda exploiting a thriller story to enrapture its xxup wwii - era xxmaj british spectators . xxmaj but mind you , it is based on a story by xxmaj english writer and xxup wwii xxup mi6 spy xxmaj graham xxmaj greene . xxmaj nevertheless , the xxmaj english were righteous in that war , remaining the only xxmaj european country the xxmaj germans intended to occupy but never could . xxmaj this piece grows to be as riveting as any other good movie , and what 's more , its unexpected violence causes it to project with particular prominence .,xxbos i heard so many good things about this movie that i thought \" xxmaj oh , i 've got to see that \" . xxmaj then i realised i 'd rented it a couple of weeks before and rather enjoyed it . i can usually remember films very clearly but this one is so predictable that it had just evaporated from my memory . xxmaj still , it 's certainly a well - acted story of social change in a small town ( despite the loathsome , stodgy music - i hate brass bands ) and worth a look . xxmaj incidentally , it 's interesting that most of the pro - xxmaj thatcher comments have been written by xxmaj americans who would be unlikely to tolerate her born - to - rule attitude . xxmaj an institution like the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords would n't last a nanosecond in the liberty - loving xxup usa , thank xxmaj god !,xxbos i 'm at a total loss when i read the other reviews about this movie . i 'm seriously wondering if we all watched the same movie . \n",

       " \n",

       " \n",
       "  5 ) xxmaj the budget was almost non - existent which means that this film did not even have the normal cushion to fall back on like it 's fellow titles in the trash bin , a $ 50 million effects and props budget . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj in short , the director of this movie seem to have aspired to reach the grandeur of an xxmaj uwe xxmaj boll production . xxmaj really says it all , does n't it ?,xxbos xxup lol , i know i stole that line from i love the 70 's , but i just thought it was so true and that was my exact thought from the first minute i started watching xxmaj the xxmaj bad xxmaj news xxmaj bears . xxmaj now to the movie , xxmaj the xxmaj bad xxmaj news xxmaj bears is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time , i almost died laughing throughout the whole movie . i obviously heard about this movie from the show i love the 70 's on xxup vh1 , way before the remake with xxmaj billy xxmaj bob xxmaj thorton . xxmaj it always slipped my mind though when i wanted to rent it , but finally i remembered and i am so glad that i got the chance to see it , because this is one of the best comedies to come out of the 70 's . \n",

       "  xxmaj taken at the xxmaj flood has to be one of my very least favorite of the entire xxmaj poirot series ( i disliked it so much that i did n't even bother to write my own plot synopsis ) . i was never a huge fan of the book , but this adaptation has some real weaknesses and problems that i just ca n't get past . xxmaj chief among them is that it never \" feels \" like an xxmaj agatha xxmaj christie story . xxmaj who decided to sauce up xxmaj christie 's work with all the sex and talk of abortion ? i suppose it was done in an attempt to attract the more modern viewer . xxmaj what about those of us who watch these movies because they are n't filled with the same garbage you can find in every other modern movie ? xxmaj beyond the bastardization of xxmaj xxunk 's novel , the denouement is terribly disappointing . xxmaj poirot brings up things about a murder that happened years ago that , not only would xxmaj poirot have had no way of knowing , the audience could n't begin to come up with the solution . xxmaj xxunk could n't have come up with half the things xxmaj poirot reveals . xxmaj and it 's not as much fun when you ca n't play along . i realize that xxmaj christie would often spring a surprise or two during one of xxmaj poirot 's final monologues , but here xxmaj poirot offers no proof . xxmaj based on the evidence , his accusations seems to be little more than wild speculation .,xxbos xxmaj the story is somewhat stilted , what with the main character 's sudden reversals of fortune , but xxmaj leslie xxmaj howard and xxmaj bette xxmaj davis 's portrayals of xxmaj philip xxmaj carey , the naïve obsessed lover and xxmaj mildred xxmaj rogers , the unworthy object of his affections , raise this film considerably above standard melodrama . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj although xxmaj leslie xxmaj howard is memorable , today \" xxmaj of xxmaj human xxmaj bondage \" is mainly thought of as a xxmaj bette xxmaj davis picture , perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight xxmaj jack xxmaj warner to get the part of xxmaj mildred , and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy . xxmaj mildred may have a grating voice , but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel , making it somewhat understandable why xxmaj philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did . xxmaj although man eating xxmaj mildred may at times seem one dimensional , she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that xxmaj philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her . xxmaj one may also think she is on to something when she accuses xxmaj philip of looking down on her for not being \" fine \" enough .

       "xxbos \" xxmaj my xxmaj favorite xxmaj year \" is a very funny and charming piece of nostalgia that wears just a little bit too much of its sincerity on its sleeve . xxmaj the opening shots of the classic xxmaj new xxmaj york skyline bring back fond memories of films set in xxmaj new xxmaj york like \" xxmaj on the xxmaj town \" and \" xxmaj bells xxmaj are xxmaj ringing \" , both of which opened with very similar views ( and both of which had lyrics by xxmaj adolph xxmaj green , who appears in the film as xxmaj leo ) . xxmaj there are many parallels to classic comedy in a broader sense as well , like the relationship between has - been swashbuckling icon xxmaj alan xxmaj swann ( xxmaj peter o'toole ) and his chauffeur / manservant which mirrors the classic xxmaj jeeves and xxmaj wooster dichotomy loosely . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the story is very straightforward  xxmaj swann must make an appearance on a xxup tv variety show hosted by xxmaj king xxmaj kaiser ( xxmaj joe xxmaj bologna ) to appease the xxup irs . xxmaj when he shows up \" plastered \" ( \" so are some of the best erections in xxmaj europe \" ! he exclaims ) for the first rehearsal he risks losing the job but is saved by nerdy writer xxmaj benjy xxmaj stone ( xxmaj mark xxmaj linn - xxmaj baker ) , who must act as his chaperone for the rest of the week in xxup nyc . xxmaj in the course of that week xxmaj stone somewhat accidentally teaches xxmaj swann that what he 's missing the most is a solid family relationship , and xxmaj swann teaches xxmaj stone how to be more confident and go after the things that he wants at all costs . xxmaj there 's also an interesting theme here concerning what we choose to show to other people . xxmaj stone confesses that his name is \" xxmaj xxunk \" or something like that , a very xxmaj jewish name , and xxmaj swann confesses about his child whom he has not seen in years . xxmaj the idea i think is that no one would guess that these two very hyper - kinetic and funny individuals were harboring such pain and guilt , but they are able to tell each other because of the mutual respect that exists between friends . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i thought the movie was very funny although in the end the plot about xxmaj swann 's family becomes a bit too obvious and sentimental . xxmaj but there are just too many hilarious moments to complain too much . xxmaj the only other comedy i 've seen with o'toole was \" xxmaj what 's xxmaj new xxmaj pussycat ? \" , which i thought was kind of lame . xxmaj he was very , very funny in this one . xxmaj an even bigger surprise is xxmaj joe xxmaj bologna in the role of a xxmaj sid xxmaj caesar - esquire comedian full of swagger and arrogance , a man who would probably blame the pope if he slipped on a banana peal in the xxmaj vatican . xxmaj the scene where he squares up with a tough gangster ( played by the appropriately surly xxmaj cameron xxmaj mitchell , taking quite a big step up from his recent films like \" xxmaj tool xxmaj box xxmaj murders \" ) is one for the ages . xxmaj and unlike a lot of show- business comedies that end in \" the big show \" ( even \" xxmaj the xxmaj producers ) the conclusion of this film was far from a let - down . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i really felt like i was watching a film from the classic era  not just because of the high quality of the script and the actors , but because this film knows how to present an innocent kind of charm in a sophisticated way ; it 's a far cry from the juvenile ( though occasionally hilarious ) films being pumped out of the teenage movie factory that xxmaj hollywood became in the 1980s . xxmaj in other words , it 's a film with class and integrity . xxmaj and speaking of \" xxmaj the xxmaj producers \" , i think a musical version of this film might be a very good idea .,xxbos xxmaj in xxup wwii xxmaj england a troop of xxunk are dispatched into a characteristically happy - go - lucky and scenic village , though really they are a select assemblage of xxmaj german officers with orders to seize control of the township on the horizon of a covert xxmaj german attack in a few days . xxmaj director xxmaj alberto xxmaj xxunk is smart . xxmaj rather than this information creeping up on us like a twist , we grasp this from the start . xxmaj when one of the villagers grows suspicious , we are in an enhanced state of tension . xxmaj the xxmaj germans hijack the parish , a handful among which refuse to lose hope of alerting the unsuspecting free world around them . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj do not make the mistake of presuming that it is an insincere propaganda yarn , considering its era . xxmaj this is in fact quite an electrifying tale of survival . xxmaj if so many can overlook the propaganda of obsolete films like xxmaj battleship xxmaj potemkin , there is certainly room for this picture . xxmaj it stands out , owing much to its unexpected flashes of violence that are sincerely exhilarating and often frank and uncompromising in terms of the drama . xxmaj it is not gritty like most modern war films . xxmaj the xxunk timeless xxmaj english ambiance , and the consistent theme of it maintaining its spry morale , is a clever and natural juxtaposition to the taut aggression of the conflict , which is thus more well - defined . xxmaj the relatively unfamiliar cast is plainly high- quality . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj at its hub , yes , it 's a work of propaganda exploiting a thriller story to enrapture its xxup wwii - era xxmaj british spectators . xxmaj but mind you , it is based on a story by xxmaj english writer and xxup wwii xxup mi6 spy xxmaj graham xxmaj greene . xxmaj nevertheless , the xxmaj english were righteous in that war , remaining the only xxmaj european country the xxmaj germans intended to occupy but never could . xxmaj this piece grows to be as riveting as any other good movie , and what 's more , its unexpected violence causes it to project with particular prominence .,xxbos i heard so many good things about this movie that i thought \" xxmaj oh , i 've got to see that \" . xxmaj then i realised i 'd rented it a couple of weeks before and rather enjoyed it . i can usually remember films very clearly but this one is so predictable that it had just evaporated from my memory . xxmaj still , it 's certainly a well - acted story of social change in a small town ( despite the loathsome , stodgy music - i hate brass bands ) and worth a look . xxmaj incidentally , it 's interesting that most of the pro - xxmaj thatcher comments have been written by xxmaj americans who would be unlikely to tolerate her born - to - rule attitude . xxmaj an institution like the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords would n't last a nanosecond in the liberty - loving xxup usa , thank xxmaj god !,xxbos i 'm at a total loss when i read the other reviews about this movie . i 'm seriously wondering if we all watched the same movie . \n",

       " \n",
       "  5 ) xxmaj the budget was almost non - existent which means that this film did not even have the normal cushion to fall back on like it 's fellow titles in the trash bin , a $ 50 million effects and props budget . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj in short , the director of this movie seem to have aspired to reach the grandeur of an xxmaj uwe xxmaj boll production . xxmaj really says it all , does n't it ?,xxbos xxup lol , i know i stole that line from i love the 70 's , but i just thought it was so true and that was my exact thought from the first minute i started watching xxmaj the xxmaj bad xxmaj news xxmaj bears . xxmaj now to the movie , xxmaj the xxmaj bad xxmaj news xxmaj bears is one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time , i almost died laughing throughout the whole movie . i obviously heard about this movie from the show i love the 70 's on xxup vh1 , way before the remake with xxmaj billy xxmaj bob xxmaj thorton . xxmaj it always slipped my mind though when i wanted to rent it , but finally i remembered and i am so glad that i got the chance to see it , because this is one of the best comedies to come out of the 70 's . \n",

       "  xxmaj taken at the xxmaj flood has to be one of my very least favorite of the entire xxmaj poirot series ( i disliked it so much that i did n't even bother to write my own plot synopsis ) . i was never a huge fan of the book , but this adaptation has some real weaknesses and problems that i just ca n't get past . xxmaj chief among them is that it never \" feels \" like an xxmaj agatha xxmaj christie story . xxmaj who decided to sauce up xxmaj christie 's work with all the sex and talk of abortion ? i suppose it was done in an attempt to attract the more modern viewer . xxmaj what about those of us who watch these movies because they are n't filled with the same garbage you can find in every other modern movie ? xxmaj beyond the bastardization of xxmaj xxunk 's novel , the denouement is terribly disappointing . xxmaj poirot brings up things about a murder that happened years ago that , not only would xxmaj poirot have had no way of knowing , the audience could n't begin to come up with the solution . xxmaj xxunk could n't have come up with half the things xxmaj poirot reveals . xxmaj and it 's not as much fun when you ca n't play along . i realize that xxmaj christie would often spring a surprise or two during one of xxmaj poirot 's final monologues , but here xxmaj poirot offers no proof . xxmaj based on the evidence , his accusations seems to be little more than wild speculation .,xxbos xxmaj the story is somewhat stilted , what with the main character 's sudden reversals of fortune , but xxmaj leslie xxmaj howard and xxmaj bette xxmaj davis 's portrayals of xxmaj philip xxmaj carey , the naïve obsessed lover and xxmaj mildred xxmaj rogers , the unworthy object of his affections , raise this film considerably above standard melodrama . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj although xxmaj leslie xxmaj howard is memorable , today \" xxmaj of xxmaj human xxmaj bondage \" is mainly thought of as a xxmaj bette xxmaj davis picture , perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight xxmaj jack xxmaj warner to get the part of xxmaj mildred , and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy . xxmaj mildred may have a grating voice , but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel , making it somewhat understandable why xxmaj philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did . xxmaj although man eating xxmaj mildred may at times seem one dimensional , she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that xxmaj philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her . xxmaj one may also think she is on to something when she accuses xxmaj philip of looking down on her for not being \" fine \" enough .

       "  xxmaj however , and fortunately for me , i saw the xxup mst3 k version of xxmaj robot xxmaj holocaust . xxmaj some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this xxup mst3 k episode a winner . xxmaj for a season one episode , the riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time . xxmaj on my xxup mst3 k rating scale , i give this episode a 4 / 5  seek it out .,xxbos i have a question for the writers and producers of \" xxmaj prozac xxmaj nation \" : xxmaj what is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in xxmaj america ? xxmaj in the moving performance of xxmaj christina xxmaj ricci as xxmaj liz xxmaj xxunk , the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a xxmaj harvard student and as a writer . xxmaj but this is not a story of success , only one of self - destruction as we watch xxmaj liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her . xxmaj the film examines divorce , family dysfunction , drugs , alcohol , and prescription medication as possible reasons for xxmaj liz 's unhappiness . xxmaj but none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj at some point in the film , it would have been helpful to suggest that xxmaj liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems . xxmaj no light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in \" xxmaj the xxmaj united xxmaj states of xxmaj depression . \" xxmaj in the story , xxmaj liz had a caring therapist ( xxmaj anne xxmaj heche ) , a caring roommate ( xxmaj michele xxmaj williams ) , a caring boyfriend ( xxmaj jason xxmaj biggs ) , and a troubled but caring parent ( xxmaj jessica xxmaj lange ) . xxmaj in a key scene in the film , xxmaj liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break - up of the space shuttle xxmaj challenger . xxmaj instead of equating xxmaj challenger with xxmaj liz 's life , the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj this film reminded me of a generic made - for - cable \" victim \" film on the xxmaj lifetime network . xxmaj an excellent cast was wasted , especially in the earnest performance of xxmaj christina xxmaj ricci . xxmaj the real - life xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj xxunk obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author . xxmaj it is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit .,xxbos i 'm working my way through the xxmaj horror xxmaj classics 50 xxmaj movie xxmaj pack xxmaj collection and xxup the xxup mad xxup monster is one of the movies in the set . \n",

       "  xxmaj in this case , like so many others of its ilk , it is a transfusion of ( i assume ) wolf 's blood into humans . xxmaj his goal is to create an invincible army , which he can control through the antidote . xxmaj the subject of his experiments is his hired hand , a retarded gardener , whose dialogue slows down this snail - paced classic to almost a full - stop . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj beyond his experiments , xxmaj dr. xxmaj cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him , using his transformed gardener . xxmaj however , he loses control of his subject , who begins to transform without the transfusion -- yikes ! \n",

       "  xxmaj the werewolf transformations are classic xxmaj hollywood stop - action / makeup effects . xxmaj no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time ; but , in today 's digital age it 's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this .,xxbos xxmaj retro xxmaj puppet xxmaj master is complete and utter xxunk particular , the puppets look stupid , and crappy . xxmaj the acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid . xxmaj this movie goes back into the the past , where the dolls where first created , thats not xxmaj puppet xxmaj master . xxmaj retro xxmaj puppet xxmaj master is rated xxunk first xxmaj puppet xxmaj master to be rated xxunk movie contains no horror , or suspense . xxmaj the fact that this movie was a xxmaj puppet xxmaj master film boggles the mind , because this installment does nt have the buckets of blood , good acting , or any xxunk like the previous movies did . xxmaj dont see this movie , dont rent it , and do nt even watch it f its on xxup tv , because this film is stale , not violent , and completely xxunk out of xxunk a xxmaj puppet xxmaj master fan , i am disappointed ... seriously .,xxbos i did have some expectations from this film because 1 . xxmaj it was a xxmaj yash raj production 2 . xxmaj when the songs were first shown on xxup tv , they seemed catchy 3 . xxmaj the star ( ? ? ! ) cast was new . xxmaj well , i must tell u that i just could n't sit through this movie . xxmaj xxunk , ( with his red lips - what were the make up artists thinking ? ? ? ! ) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably . i wo n't even get started on his acting ( if u can call it that ) . ' xxmaj cleavage queen ' xxmaj xxunk with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration . i think xxmaj xxunk was slightly more tolerable than her ! xxmaj she seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister . xxmaj the story is pathetic ... the same old tried and tested formula . xxmaj absolutely no originality . xxmaj there is nothing worth watching in this movie . xxmaj makes me wonder why it was made in the first place !\n",

       "  xxmaj the werewolf transformations are classic xxmaj hollywood stop - action / makeup effects . xxmaj no doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time ; but , in today 's digital age it 's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this .,xxbos xxmaj retro xxmaj puppet xxmaj master is complete and utter xxunk particular , the puppets look stupid , and crappy . xxmaj the acting was unforgivable and the story was rancid . xxmaj this movie goes back into the the past , where the dolls where first created , thats not xxmaj puppet xxmaj master . xxmaj retro xxmaj puppet xxmaj master is rated xxunk first xxmaj puppet xxmaj master to be rated xxunk movie contains no horror , or suspense . xxmaj the fact that this movie was a xxmaj puppet xxmaj master film boggles the mind , because this installment does nt have the buckets of blood , good acting , or any xxunk like the previous movies did . xxmaj dont see this movie , dont rent it , and do nt even watch it f its on xxup tv , because this film is stale , not violent , and completely xxunk out of xxunk a xxmaj puppet xxmaj master fan , i am disappointed ... seriously .,xxbos i did have some expectations from this film because 1 . xxmaj it was a xxmaj yash raj production 2 . xxmaj when the songs were first shown on xxup tv , they seemed catchy 3 . xxmaj the star ( ? ? ! ) cast was new . xxmaj well , i must tell u that i just could n't sit through this movie . xxmaj xxunk , ( with his red lips - what were the make up artists thinking ? ? ? ! ) tries hard to look cool but fails miserably . i wo n't even get started on his acting ( if u can call it that ) . ' xxmaj cleavage queen ' xxmaj xxunk with all her screaming and ranting n raving just makes you want to pull your hair out in frustration . i think xxmaj xxunk was slightly more tolerable than her ! xxmaj she seriously needs to take acting lessons from her sister . xxmaj the story is pathetic ... the same old tried and tested formula . xxmaj absolutely no originality . xxmaj there is nothing worth watching in this movie . xxmaj makes me wonder why it was made in the first place !\n",
